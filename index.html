    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <h5>Ethan Maxey is currently a junior at the University of Houston, studying computer science. Initially, Ethan began
        his professional education at Texas A&M - Commerce as a music performance major, but soon discovered computer
        science was his true calling. Ethan is proficient with HTML, CSS, Python,  C++ and familiar with Java. He likes to
        spend his time developing software and working with people to make his ideas come to life. When he isn't coding, he
        enjoys traveling to new places, spending time in nature, and he has a fascination for all different kinds of wildlife
        (especially his cat T.J. and dog Romeo.)
        <br><br>
        His strong leadership skills advocate for him as the best candidate for any position because these skills require
        great self-discipline, self-motivation, intuition, time management, and extremely adept learning abilities! Ethan
        is motivated by his passion for helping people with hopes to write code that can help people in ways such as finding affordable housing,
        aiding scholarship opportunities, assisting students in being passionate about their education, and more projects similar to these.
        <br><br>
        Even though Ethan lacks professional experience as a Software Developer, his problem-solving and fast learning techniques qualify him
		over more experienced candidates. Not only is he technically intelligent, but Ethan is also emotionally intelligent and is the best team
		player you will ever meet. Ethan loves to solve problems, the harder, the better. He loves challenges because he accepts that even when he
		graduates his education will never be over, and the greater the challenge, the greater the learning oppurtunity.
