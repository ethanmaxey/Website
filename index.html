    <hr>
    <h5>Ethan Maxey is a student at the University of Houston, studying Computer Science. Initially, Ethan began
        his professional education at Texas A&M - Commerce studying music, but soon discovered computer
        science was his true calling. Ethan is proficient with C++
        <br>
        <br>
        Along with being a student, he is a Freelance Website Developer. He is currently accepting new clients!
        <br>
        <br>
        His strong leadership skills advocate for him as the best candidate for any position because these skills
        require great self-discipline, self-motivation, intuition, time management, and adept learning abilities. Ethan
        is motivated by his passion for helping people and hopes to write code that can improve people's quality of
        life.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ethan's problem-solving and quick-learning techniques qualify him over more experienced candidates. More
        important than his intellect, he is emotionally intelligent and the most driven team player you will ever
        communicate with. Ethan loves to solve problems, the harder, the better.
